1. Application of splines. Where are they used in engineering? What are some examples of splines that engineers use? What are the downsides to the ones they use (and what are the benefits)? Can you give some history on the use of splines and the bespoke splines used in different engineering industries?
2. Discussion of LU and Cholesky factorization. How they work, why they work, why they are better than inverting a matrix.
3. Software for linear equations, LAPACK, BLAS, and vendor-specific varieties on them. How they are used. How supercomputers are benchmarked using them. Why supercomputers are benchmarked using them.
4. Derivative-free methods for rootfinding: Bisection, Secant, etc. How they work, why they work, what could go wrong.
5. Floating point number systems. Include some examples of non-standard (non-IEEE) floating point systems. When one might use various types of floating point systems. How they are implemented in software and hardware. Why different hardware may only natively support certain types of floating point numbers.
6. The SVD. What is it, what it can be used for, how it can be computed.
7. What is interpolation, what is it used for (broadly construed, including in the context of numerical integration), how one should choose what kind of interpolation method to use, differences between least squares fitting.
8. Software: How does one compute eigenvalues for big problems in practice? What about for specific types of matrices, like symmetric or SPD? Examples should be libraries used in HPC applications (not Python implemenations).
9. Piecewise interpolation. Why we do it. Include a discussion of splines, including B-splines (not explicitly discussed in class). How splines differ from other types of interpolants.
10. Fixed-point iteration methods and Newton's method. How they work, why they work, what gould go wrong.
